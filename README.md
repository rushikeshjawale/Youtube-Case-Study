Youtube Case Study
Project Description
YouTube is a source of income for a lot of people. It started as an excellent platform to upload videos to share knowledge, experiences, and tutorials. Also, many people have dedicated their lives to creating content just for youtube and so many have earned not only recognition and fame but also money.

In this case study, we analyze certain features and try to find an appropriate outcome or data. This data will help understand youtube's chronology that will help them build or start their own business on this platform.

This case study also helps other businesses in digital marketing that use youtube platform for marketing and advertising. By studying the extracted data, we can analyze which category of video is most watched, loved and disliked by viewers.

Below are some problem statements that have been considered and solved.

â€¢ Q1) Perform Sentiment Analysis on comment feature and prepare word cloud:
Solution:

To perform the sentiment analysis you should consider two key points polarity and subjectivity.

polarity value lies between the range of -1 to +1, so if polarity of comment is near to -1 or less than 0 the comment is consider as negative and if polarity value is close to +1 or more than zero then comment is consider positive. After performing Sentiment analysis These are the results. To conduct emoji analysis. First, we install and import the emoji library and then extract emojis using the for loop inside the list comprehension method. An emoji library is the library which contains emojis with respect to their unincode. Next extract emojis from the data and append it into another list. Now we import counter from collection library, then we use our current extracted emoji list in counter function to count how many time a particular emoji has be utilized. You will get dictionary data type collection in which emojis will act like key and theri respective values will be their total count. Then we extract most common 10 emojis. Now store all the keys(emojis) into one list and values(count) into another list. Then plot those top 10 emojis on bar graph using plotly.

Programming Language Trends - Findings & Implications
Findings
JavaScript and HTML/CSS continue to be the top two most popular programming languages for this year and next.

Python and TypeScript have gained more interest for next year.

Whereas interest in SQL and Bash/Shell/PowerShell has decreased.

Implications
Continue to employ a similar number of people skilled in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Employ more people skilled in Python and TypeScript.

Employ less people skilled in SQL and Bash/Shell/PowerShell.

Discussion
Technology Trends now and future

Training and Re-skilling workers

Females participation in Technology field

Bridge divide of technology gaps in developing countries

Eliminate age and education discrimination in employment

Ovearall Findings and Implications
Findings
Programming Languages- TypeScript is gaining significant interest and Python continues to grow as well.

Databases- Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and MongoDB are gaining more interest.

Platforms- Interest Slack and Windows is dropping significantly.

WebFrames- Vue.js is gaining substantial interest and React.js continues to grow as well.

Implications
Continue to staff enough JavaScript and HTML/CSS but employ more people skilled in TypeScript and Python.

Employ more people skilled in Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

Continue to staff enough ASP.NET but employ more people skilled in Vue.js and React.js.

Continue to staff enough Linux, employ more peopleskilled in Docker, AWS and Android, butmake reductionsto Slack and Windows.

Conclusion
Carve out budget in order to hire additional staff with skills needed to fill any gaps.

Set aside budget or put a program in place to upskill those already employed.

Make adjustmentsin staff for those skills no longer in demand.
