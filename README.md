# Youtube Case Study
## Project Description:

YouTube is a source of income for a lot of people. It started as an excellent platform to upload videos to share knowledge, experiences, and tutorials. Also, many people have dedicated their lives to creating content just for youtube and so many have earned not only recognition and fame but also money.

In this case study, we analyze certain features and try to find an appropriate outcome or data. This data will help understand youtube's chronology that will help them build or start their own business on this platform.

This case study also helps other businesses in digital marketing that use youtube platform for marketing and advertising. By studying the extracted data, we can analyze which category of video is most watched, loved and disliked by viewers.

Below are some problem statements that have been considered and solved

Then i begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases.   
 
 

Once this was completed, i made that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. 
 


once the data was ready i applied statistical techniques to analyze the data.  Then i collected all this information together by using  IBM Cognos Analytics to create my dashboard. And finally, showed off my storytelling skills by sharing my findings in a presentation.

# Ovearall Findings and Implications

## Findings

1. Programming Languages- TypeScript is gaining significant interest and Python continues to grow as well.

2. Databases- Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL and MongoDB are gaining more interest.

3. Platforms- Interest Slack and Windows is dropping significantly.

4. WebFrames- Vue.js is gaining substantial interest and React.js continues to grow as well.

## Implications

1. Continue to staff enough JavaScript and HTML/CSS but employ more people skilled in TypeScript and Python.

# Conclusion

1. Carve out budget in order to hire additional staff with skills needed to fill any gaps.

2. Set aside budget or put a program in place to upskill those already employed.

3. Make adjustmentsin staff for those skills no longer in demand.
